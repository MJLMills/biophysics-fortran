==================

This is the calculation engine for dynamics runs.

This program takes an input file generated by a GUI and runs the appropriate
calculation, ideally faster than it would run in the GUI.

Shared Memory Runs with OpenMP

To use OpenMP capabilities, edit the namelist OMP.nml. Here you can set the max number 
of threads, and turn on/off the dynamic allocation and nested parallelism features of 
OpenMP. In addition, if you would like to use the environment variables

  $OMP_NUM_THREADS, $OMP_DYNAMIC & $OMP_NESTED

rather than the namelist, then you can set the variable 'useNameList' to .FALSE., 
in which case the compiler defaults will be used, unless the above environment 
variables are set, in which case they take precedence. 
Any variables omitted from the namelist will go to their program defaults:

numThreads = OMP_get_num_threads()
dynamicAllocation = .FALSE.
nestedParallelism = .FALSE.
useNamelist = .TRUE.
